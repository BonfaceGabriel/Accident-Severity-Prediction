# Accident Severity Prediction

### Introduction
This project aims to predict the severity of accidents based on various input features. 
We use the Random Forest classifier, an ensemble learning technique, to achieve accurate accident severity predictions.

### Overview
- The app allows a user to key in inputs which it then uses to predict the severity of the accident based on those attributes,

### Installation
To run the project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once you have all the requirements installed you run the app:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
### Use
The user then enters variables on a form then click on a predict button to reveal the severity.
